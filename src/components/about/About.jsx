          I'm Jayawanth Rayakota Harnath, a passionate Software Engineer, with a strong foundation in full-stack development and a keen interest in data science. My journey in technology has been driven by a desire to build scalable, data-driven applications that not only solve complex problems but also deliver meaningful value to users.
